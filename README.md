# AUTOMATED PLANT WATERING SYSTEM

Introduction
--
In this project, we will build an automated water planting system using IoT components to monitor and manage soil moisture levels effectively. The system leverages a soil moisture sensor to detect the moisture content in soil, ensuring plants receive water when needed. The sensor’s data is displayed on an LCD screen connected via an I2C module, providing clear, real-time feedback on soil conditions. To enhance functionality, an RGB LED provides visual indicators of moisture levels—changing colour based on dryness or excess water—and a buzzer alerts when immediate attention is required. Through this experiment, we’ll learn how to integrate sensors, displays, and alert mechanisms to create a fully functional and interactive plant monitoring system.
