*Note:
There is a drip bowl located under the plant, inside the mountain to collect excess water from the pot drainage holes. After every use, ensure that the drip bowl is empty. In the case that there is water,  utilise the water pump motor and moisture sensor to drain it out. Use a paper towel to completely dry the bowl.*
